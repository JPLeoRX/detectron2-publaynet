Here I present [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) object detection models trained on [PubLayNet](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/publaynet/) dataset, ranging from 81.139 to 86.690 in validation AP scores (possibly even better results can be achieved with longer training times).

# Dataset overview

PubLayNet is a very large (over 300k images & over 90 GB in weight) dataset for document layout analysis. It contains images of research papers and articles and annotations for various elements in a page such as “text”, “list”, “figure” etc in these research paper images. The dataset was obtained by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central. Originally provided by IBM [here](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/publaynet).

# Models overview

Models were trained on `train` part of the dataset, consisting of 335 703 images, and evaluated on `val` part of the dataset with 11 245 images. All the AP scores were obtained on the `val` dataset. Inference times were taken from official Detectron model zoo descriptions.

To provide you with some options, and to experiment with different models I have trained 4 versions for this dataset. 2 of them are from basic object detection, and 2 contain segmentation masks. You can choose which better suits your task by comparing accuracy scores and inference times of these models.

### Model folder

Each model's directory in git will contain these files:

| File name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| download.txt  | A text file that contains a link from where you can download the trained model |
| train.py  | Training script, that trains the model found in `training_output` sub-folder for a given number of epochs |
| test.py  | Testing script, that runs the model found in `training_output` in inference mode for 6 randomly preselected images (3 from training, 3 from evaluation datasets) and displays all predictions on each image in a pop-up window |
| eval.py  | Testing script, that runs the model found in `training_output` in inference mode for all images found in dataset's `val` folder and `val.json`. Evaluation is performed through Detectron's `COCOEvaluator` |
| evaluation.txt | As `eval.py` takes some time to execute (from 10 to 20 minutes) I've recorded last output of evaluation in this separate text file |

Generally all trained models `.pth` files should be available through [here](https://keybase.pub/jpleorx/detectron2-publaynet/) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BeTAb8BlS9DiEb_ndoAh1fKyq16i6FC?usp=sharing), but if not - refer to individual `download.txt` links

# Using the models

In `usage_example` module I've provided a sample script `example.py` that builds Detectron objects (config and predictor) for my trained model and runs inference on it, with a sample interpretation of Detectron's outputs. Please note that `test.py` and `eval.py` in model folders use common functions shared between models in this project. While `example.py` provides a completely clean setup, assuming you only want to download the models and use them for inference directly. It requires only Pillow, OpenCV, numpy and Detectron2 to run.

# Hardware used

Believe it or not but training of these models was performed on a regular consumer-grade personal gaming PC with one NVIDIA 2070 SUPER (8GB) GPU, Intel Core i5-10600K CPU and 32 GB RAM.
